While pursuing my dream of becoming a Frontend Software Engineer, I work part-time as a wedding caterer and bartender. At weddings, I’m often responsible for crafting the bride and groom’s signature cocktails. They provide the alcohol, and I serve the guests, but I frequently encounter guests asking, “What else can you make?” This question can be challenging since each wedding features a unique selection of ingredients and liquors, making it difficult to come up with drink ideas on the spot while serving efficiently.

That’s what inspired me to create Bar Buddy, a web application designed to simplify this process. Bartenders can input the alcohol and ingredients they have on hand, and the app generates a list of cocktails they can create, complete with step-by-step instructions. This tool not only helps bartenders save time but also enhances the guest experience with personalized drink options.
