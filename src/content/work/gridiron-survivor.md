Gridiron Survivor is an open source project building an NFL Survivor pool SaaS application. The individuals on this team operate using a corporate process to ensure the highest quality of production.

In an NFL survivor pool, each week, players in the pool will choose one team they expect to win. If that team wins, the player moves on to the next week to pick again. The player is eliminated from the pool if that team does not win.

In this project, I stepped into a Frontend Functional Software Engineer role, where I focus on connecting our backend services and database (Appwrite) with the frontend. My main tasks are to create reusable functions that make our pages run smoother and build out all the component features the UX team needs to bring their designs to life.
