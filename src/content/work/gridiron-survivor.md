Gridiron Survivor is an open source project building an NFL Survivor pool SaaS application. The individuals on this team operate using a corporate process to ensure the highest quality of production.

In an NFL survivor pool, each week, players in the pool will choose one team they expect to win. If that team wins, the player moves on to the next week to pick again. The player is eliminated from the pool if that team does not win.
